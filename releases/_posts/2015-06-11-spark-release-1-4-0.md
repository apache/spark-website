Spark 1.4.0 is the fifth release on the 1.X line. This release brings an R API to Spark. It also brings usability improvements in Spark’s core engine and expansion of MLlib and Spark Streaming. Spark 1.4 represents the work of more than 210 contributors from more than 70 institutions in more than 1000 individual patches.

To download Spark 1.4 visit the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads.html">downloads</a> page.

### SparkR
Spark 1.4 is the first release to package SparkR, an R binding for Spark based
on Spark's new DataFrame API. SparkR gives R users access to Spark's scale-out
parallel runtime along with all of Spark's input and output formats. It also
supports calling directly into Spark SQL. 
The [R programming guide](/docs/1.4.0/sparkr.html) has more information on how to get up and running with
SparkR.

### Spark Core

Spark core adds a variety of improvements focused on operations, performance, and compatibility:
