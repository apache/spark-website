<h2><span class="text-capitalize">Apache Spark<span class="tm">&trade;</span></span> history</h2>

<p>
Apache Spark started as a research project at the <a href="https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley AMPLab</a>
in 2009, and was open sourced in early 2010.
Many of the ideas behind the system were presented in various
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/research.html">research papers</a> over the years.
</p>

<p>
After being released, Spark grew into a broad developer community, and moved to the
<a href="https://www.apache.org">Apache Software Foundation</a> in 2013.
Today, the project is developed collaboratively by a community of hundreds of developers from
hundreds of organizations.
