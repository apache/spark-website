### Latest Preview Release
Preview releases, as the name suggests, are releases for previewing upcoming features.
Unlike nightly packages, preview releases have been audited by the project's management committee
to satisfy the legal requirements of Apache Software Foundation's release policy.
Preview releases are not meant to be functional, i.e. they can and highly likely will contain
critical bugs or documentation errors.
The latest preview release is Spark 3.0.0-preview2, published on Dec 23, 2019.
