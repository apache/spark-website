<p>Spark provides three locations to configure the system:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#spark-properties">Spark properties</a> control most application parameters and can be set by using
a <a href="api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.SparkConf">SparkConf</a> object, or through Java
system properties.</li>
  <li><a href="#environment-variables">Environment variables</a> can be used to set per-machine settings, such as
the IP address, through the <code>conf/spark-env.sh</code> script on each node.</li>
  <li><a href="#configuring-logging">Logging</a> can be configured through <code>log4j.properties</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="spark-properties">Spark Properties</h1>

<p>Spark properties control most application settings and are configured separately for each
application. These properties can be set directly on a
<a href="api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.SparkConf">SparkConf</a> passed to your
<code>SparkContext</code>. <code>SparkConf</code> allows you to configure some of the common properties
(e.g. master URL and application name), as well as arbitrary key-value pairs through the
<code>set()</code> method. For example, we could initialize an application with two threads as follows:</p>

<p>Note that we run with local[2], meaning two threads - which represents &#8220;minimal&#8221; parallelism,
which can help detect bugs that only exist when we run in a distributed context.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"><span></span><span class="k">val</span> <span class="n">conf</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">SparkConf</span><span class="o">()</span>
             <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">setMaster</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;local[2]&quot;</span><span class="o">)</span>
             <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">setAppName</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;CountingSheep&quot;</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="k">val</span> <span class="n">sc</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">SparkContext</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">conf</span><span class="o">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Note that we can have more than 1 thread in local mode, and in cases like Spark Streaming, we may
actually require more than 1 thread to prevent any sort of starvation issues.</p>

<p>Properties that specify some time duration should be configured with a unit of time.
The following format is accepted:</p>

<pre><code>25ms (milliseconds)
5s (seconds)
10m or 10min (minutes)
3h (hours)
5d (days)
1y (years)
</code></pre>

<p>Properties that specify a byte size should be configured with a unit of size.
The following format is accepted:</p>

<pre><code>1b (bytes)
1k or 1kb (kibibytes = 1024 bytes)
1m or 1mb (mebibytes = 1024 kibibytes)
1g or 1gb (gibibytes = 1024 mebibytes)
1t or 1tb (tebibytes = 1024 gibibytes)
1p or 1pb (pebibytes = 1024 tebibytes)
</code></pre>

<h2 id="dynamically-loading-spark-properties">Dynamically Loading Spark Properties</h2>

<p>In some cases, you may want to avoid hard-coding certain configurations in a <code>SparkConf</code>. For
instance, if you&#8217;d like to run the same application with different masters or different
amounts of memory. Spark allows you to simply create an empty conf:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"><span></span><span class="k">val</span> <span class="n">sc</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">SparkContext</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">SparkConf</span><span class="o">())</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Then, you can supply configuration values at runtime:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span></span>./bin/spark-submit --name <span class="s2">&quot;My app&quot;</span> --master local<span class="o">[</span><span class="m">4</span><span class="o">]</span> --conf spark.eventLog.enabled<span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">false</span>
  --conf <span class="s2">&quot;spark.executor.extraJavaOptions=-XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps&quot;</span> myApp.jar</code></pre></figure>

<p>The Spark shell and <a href="submitting-applications.html"><code>spark-submit</code></a>
tool support two ways to load configurations dynamically. The first are command line options,
such as <code>--master</code>, as shown above. <code>spark-submit</code> can accept any Spark property using the <code>--conf</code>
flag, but uses special flags for properties that play a part in launching the Spark application.
Running <code>./bin/spark-submit --help</code> will show the entire list of these options.</p>

<p><code>bin/spark-submit</code> will also read configuration options from <code>conf/spark-defaults.conf</code>, in which
each line consists of a key and a value separated by whitespace. For example:</p>

<pre><code>spark.master            spark://5.6.7.8:7077
spark.executor.memory   4g
spark.eventLog.enabled  true
spark.serializer        org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer
</code></pre>

<p>Any values specified as flags or in the properties file will be passed on to the application
and merged with those specified through SparkConf. Properties set directly on the SparkConf
take highest precedence, then flags passed to <code>spark-submit</code> or <code>spark-shell</code>, then options
in the <code>spark-defaults.conf</code> file. A few configuration keys have been renamed since earlier
versions of Spark; in such cases, the older key names are still accepted, but take lower
precedence than any instance of the newer key.</p>

<h2 id="viewing-spark-properties">Viewing Spark Properties</h2>

<p>The application web UI at <code>http://&lt;driver&gt;:4040</code> lists Spark properties in the &#8220;Environment&#8221; tab.
This is a useful place to check to make sure that your properties have been set correctly. Note
that only values explicitly specified through <code>spark-defaults.conf</code>, <code>SparkConf</code>, or the command
line will appear. For all other configuration properties, you can assume the default value is used.</p>

<h2 id="available-properties">Available Properties</h2>

<p>Most of the properties that control internal settings have reasonable default values. Some
of the most common options to set are:</p>

<h3 id="application-properties">Application Properties</h3>

<table class="table">
<tr><th>Property Name</th><th>Default</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.app.name</code></td>
  <td>(none)</td>
  <td>

  <td>
    Number of cores to use for the driver process, only in cluster mode.

    Limit of total size of serialized results of all partitions for each Spark action (e.g. collect).
    Should be at least 1M, or 0 for unlimited. Jobs will be aborted if the total size
    is above this limit.
    Having a high limit may cause out-of-memory errors in driver (depends on spark.driver.memory
    and memory overhead of objects in JVM). Setting a proper limit can protect the driver from
    out-of-memory errors.
  </td>
</tr>

  <td><code>spark.driver.memory</code></td>
  <td>1g</td>
  <td>
    Amount of memory to use for the driver process, i.e. where SparkContext is initialized.
    (e.g. <code>1g</code>, <code>2g</code>).

    <br /><em>Note:</em> In client mode, this config must not be set through the <code>SparkConf</code>
    directly in your application, because the driver JVM has already started at that point.
    Instead, please set this through the <code>--driver-memory</code> command line option
    or in your default properties file.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.executor.memory</code></td>

  <td>(none)</td>
  <td>
    A comma-separated list of classes that implement <code>SparkListener</code>; when initializing
    SparkContext, instances of these classes will be created and registered with Spark's listener
    bus.  If a class has a single-argument constructor that accepts a SparkConf, that constructor
    will be called; otherwise, a zero-argument constructor will be called. If no valid constructor
    can be found, the SparkContext creation will fail with an exception.
  </td>

  <td>
    Directory to use for "scratch" space in Spark, including map output files and RDDs that get
    stored on disk. This should be on a fast, local disk in your system. It can also be a
    comma-separated list of multiple directories on different disks.

    NOTE: In Spark 1.0 and later this will be overridden by SPARK_LOCAL_DIRS (Standalone, Mesos) or
    LOCAL_DIRS (YARN) environment variables set by the cluster manager.

<h3 id="cluster-managers">Cluster Managers</h3>

<p>Each cluster manager in Spark has additional configuration options. Configurations
can be found on the pages for each mode:</p>

<h4 id="yarn"><a href="running-on-yarn.html#configuration">YARN</a></h4>

<h4 id="mesos"><a href="running-on-mesos.html#configuration">Mesos</a></h4>

<h4 id="standalone-mode"><a href="spark-standalone.html#cluster-launch-scripts">Standalone Mode</a></h4>

<h1 id="environment-variables">Environment Variables</h1>

<p>Certain Spark settings can be configured through environment variables, which are read from the
<code>conf/spark-env.sh</code> script in the directory where Spark is installed (or <code>conf/spark-env.cmd</code> on
Windows). In Standalone and Mesos modes, this file can give machine specific information such as
hostnames. It is also sourced when running local Spark applications or submission scripts.</p>

<p>Note that <code>conf/spark-env.sh</code> does not exist by default when Spark is installed. However, you can
copy <code>conf/spark-env.sh.template</code> to create it. Make sure you make the copy executable.</p>

<p>The following variables can be set in <code>spark-env.sh</code>:</p>

<table class="table">
  <tr><th style="width:21%">Environment Variable</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>JAVA_HOME</code></td>
    <td>Location where Java is installed (if it's not on your default <code>PATH</code>).</td>

  <tr>
    <td><code>PYSPARK_PYTHON</code></td>
    <td>Python binary executable to use for PySpark in both driver and workers (default is <code>python2.7</code> if available, otherwise <code>python</code>).
    Property <code>spark.pyspark.python</code> take precedence if it is set</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON</code></td>
    <td>Python binary executable to use for PySpark in driver only (default is <code>PYSPARK_PYTHON</code>).
    Property <code>spark.pyspark.driver.python</code> take precedence if it is set</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>SPARKR_DRIVER_R</code></td>
    <td>R binary executable to use for SparkR shell (default is <code>R</code>).
    Property <code>spark.r.shell.command</code> take precedence if it is set</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>SPARK_LOCAL_IP</code></td>
    <td>IP address of the machine to bind to.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>SPARK_PUBLIC_DNS</code></td>
    <td>Hostname your Spark program will advertise to other machines.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>In addition to the above, there are also options for setting up the Spark
<a href="spark-standalone.html#cluster-launch-scripts">standalone cluster scripts</a>, such as number of cores
to use on each machine and maximum memory.</p>

<p>Since <code>spark-env.sh</code> is a shell script, some of these can be set programmatically &#8211; for example, you might
compute <code>SPARK_LOCAL_IP</code> by looking up the IP of a specific network interface.</p>

<p>Note: When running Spark on YARN in <code>cluster</code> mode, environment variables need to be set using the <code>spark.yarn.appMasterEnv.[EnvironmentVariableName]</code> property in your <code>conf/spark-defaults.conf</code> file.  Environment variables that are set in <code>spark-env.sh</code> will not be reflected in the YARN Application Master process in <code>cluster</code> mode.  See the <a href="running-on-yarn.html#spark-properties">YARN-related Spark Properties</a> for more information.</p>

<h1 id="configuring-logging">Configuring Logging</h1>

<p>Spark uses <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/">log4j</a> for logging. You can configure it by adding a
<code>log4j.properties</code> file in the <code>conf</code> directory. One way to start is to copy the existing
<code>log4j.properties.template</code> located there.</p>

<h1 id="overriding-configuration-directory">Overriding configuration directory</h1>

<p>To specify a different configuration directory other than the default &#8220;SPARK_HOME/conf&#8221;,
you can set SPARK_CONF_DIR. Spark will use the configuration files (spark-defaults.conf, spark-env.sh, log4j.properties, etc)
from this directory.</p>

<h1 id="inheriting-hadoop-cluster-configuration">Inheriting Hadoop Cluster Configuration</h1>

<p>If you plan to read and write from HDFS using Spark, there are two Hadoop configuration files that
should be included on Spark&#8217;s classpath:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>hdfs-site.xml</code>, which provides default behaviors for the HDFS client.</li>
  <li><code>core-site.xml</code>, which sets the default filesystem name.</li>
</ul>

<p>The location of these configuration files varies across CDH and HDP versions, but
a common location is inside of <code>/etc/hadoop/conf</code>. Some tools, such as Cloudera Manager, create
configurations on-the-fly, but offer a mechanisms to download copies of them.</p>

<p>To make these files visible to Spark, set <code>HADOOP_CONF_DIR</code> in <code>$SPARK_HOME/spark-env.sh</code>
to a location containing the configuration files.</p>
