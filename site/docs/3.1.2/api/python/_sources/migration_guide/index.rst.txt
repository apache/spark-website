This page describes the migration guide specific to PySpark.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   pyspark_2.4_to_3.0

   pyspark_2.2_to_2.3
   pyspark_1.4_to_1.5
   pyspark_1.0_1.2_to_1.3


Many items of other migration guides can also be applied when migrating PySpark to higher versions because PySpark internally shares other components.
