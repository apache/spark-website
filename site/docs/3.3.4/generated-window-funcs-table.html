      in the ranking sequence.</td>

      before the current row in the window. The default value of `offset` is 1 and the default
      value of `default` is null. If the value of `input` at the `offset`th row is null,
      null is returned. If there is no such offset row (e.g., when the offset is 1, the first
      row of the window does not have any previous row), `default` is returned.</td>

      after the current row in the window. The default value of `offset` is 1 and the default
      value of `default` is null. If the value of `input` at the `offset`th row is null,
      null is returned. If there is no such an offset row (e.g., when the offset is 1, the last
      row of the window does not have any subsequent row), `default` is returned.</td>

      <td>nth_value(input[, offset])</td>
      <td>Returns the value of `input` at the row that is the `offset`th row
      from beginning of the window frame. Offset starts at 1. If ignoreNulls=true, we will skip
      nulls when finding the `offset`th row. Otherwise, every row counts for the `offset`. If
      there is no such an `offset`th row (e.g., when the offset is 10, size of the window frame
      is less than 10), null is returned.</td>

      <td>Computes the rank of a value in a group of values. The result is one plus the number
