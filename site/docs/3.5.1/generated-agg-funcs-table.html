      from least to greatest) such that no more than `percentage` of `col` values is less than
      the value or equal to that value. The value of percentage must be between 0.0 and 1.0.
      The `accuracy` parameter (default: 10000) is a positive numeric literal which controls
      approximation accuracy at the cost of memory. Higher value of `accuracy` yields better
      accuracy, `1.0/accuracy` is the relative error of the approximation.
      When `percentage` is an array, each value of the percentage array must be between 0.0 and 1.0.
      In this case, returns the approximate percentile array of column `col` at the given
      percentage array.</td>

      The return value is an array of (x,y) pairs representing the centers of the
      histogram's bins. As the value of 'nb' is increased, the histogram approximation
      gets finer-grained, but may yield artifacts around outliers. In practice, 20-40
      histogram bins appear to work well, with more bins being required for skewed or
      smaller datasets. Note that this function creates a histogram with non-uniform
      bin widths. It offers no guarantees in terms of the mean-squared-error of the
      histogram, but in practice is comparable to the histograms produced by the R/S-Plus
      statistical computing packages. Note: the output type of the 'x' field in the return value is
      propagated from the input value consumed in the aggregate function.</td>
