<p>Spark provides three locations to configure the system:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#spark-properties">Spark properties</a> control most application parameters and can be set by using
a <a href="api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.SparkConf">SparkConf</a> object, or through Java
system properties.</li>
  <li><a href="#environment-variables">Environment variables</a> can be used to set per-machine settings, such as
the IP address, through the <code>conf/spark-env.sh</code> script on each node.</li>
  <li><a href="#configuring-logging">Logging</a> can be configured through <code>log4j.properties</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="spark-properties">Spark Properties</h1>

<p>Spark properties control most application settings and are configured separately for each
application. These properties can be set directly on a
<a href="api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.SparkConf">SparkConf</a> passed to your
<code>SparkContext</code>. <code>SparkConf</code> allows you to configure some of the common properties
(e.g. master URL and application name), as well as arbitrary key-value pairs through the
<code>set()</code> method. For example, we could initialize an application with two threads as follows:</p>

<p>Note that we run with local[2], meaning two threads - which represents &#8220;minimal&#8221; parallelism,
which can help detect bugs that only exist when we run in a distributed context.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"><span></span><span class="k">val</span> <span class="n">conf</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">SparkConf</span><span class="o">()</span>
             <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">setMaster</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;local[2]&quot;</span><span class="o">)</span>
             <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">setAppName</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;CountingSheep&quot;</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="k">val</span> <span class="n">sc</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">SparkContext</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">conf</span><span class="o">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Note that we can have more than 1 thread in local mode, and in cases like Spark Streaming, we may
actually require more than 1 thread to prevent any sort of starvation issues.</p>

<p>Properties that specify some time duration should be configured with a unit of time.
The following format is accepted:</p>

<pre><code>25ms (milliseconds)
5s (seconds)
10m or 10min (minutes)
3h (hours)
5d (days)
1y (years)
</code></pre>

<p>Properties that specify a byte size should be configured with a unit of size.
The following format is accepted:</p>

<pre><code>1b (bytes)
1k or 1kb (kibibytes = 1024 bytes)
1m or 1mb (mebibytes = 1024 kibibytes)
1g or 1gb (gibibytes = 1024 mebibytes)
1t or 1tb (tebibytes = 1024 gibibytes)
1p or 1pb (pebibytes = 1024 tebibytes)
</code></pre>

<p>While numbers without units are generally interpreted as bytes, a few are interpreted as KiB or MiB.
See documentation of individual configuration properties. Specifying units is desirable where 
possible.</p>

<h2 id="dynamically-loading-spark-properties">Dynamically Loading Spark Properties</h2>

<p>In some cases, you may want to avoid hard-coding certain configurations in a <code>SparkConf</code>. For
instance, if you&#8217;d like to run the same application with different masters or different
amounts of memory. Spark allows you to simply create an empty conf:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"><span></span><span class="k">val</span> <span class="n">sc</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">SparkContext</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">SparkConf</span><span class="o">())</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Then, you can supply configuration values at runtime:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span></span>./bin/spark-submit --name <span class="s2">&quot;My app&quot;</span> --master local<span class="o">[</span><span class="m">4</span><span class="o">]</span> --conf spark.eventLog.enabled<span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">false</span>
  --conf <span class="s2">&quot;spark.executor.extraJavaOptions=-XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps&quot;</span> myApp.jar</code></pre></figure>

<p>The Spark shell and <a href="submitting-applications.html"><code>spark-submit</code></a>
tool support two ways to load configurations dynamically. The first is command line options,
such as <code>--master</code>, as shown above. <code>spark-submit</code> can accept any Spark property using the <code>--conf</code>
flag, but uses special flags for properties that play a part in launching the Spark application.
Running <code>./bin/spark-submit --help</code> will show the entire list of these options.</p>

<p><code>bin/spark-submit</code> will also read configuration options from <code>conf/spark-defaults.conf</code>, in which
each line consists of a key and a value separated by whitespace. For example:</p>

<pre><code>spark.master            spark://5.6.7.8:7077
spark.executor.memory   4g
spark.eventLog.enabled  true
spark.serializer        org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer
</code></pre>

<p>Any values specified as flags or in the properties file will be passed on to the application
and merged with those specified through SparkConf. Properties set directly on the SparkConf
take highest precedence, then flags passed to <code>spark-submit</code> or <code>spark-shell</code>, then options
in the <code>spark-defaults.conf</code> file. A few configuration keys have been renamed since earlier
versions of Spark; in such cases, the older key names are still accepted, but take lower
precedence than any instance of the newer key.</p>

<p>Spark properties mainly can be divided into two kinds: one is related to deploy, like
&#8220;spark.driver.memory&#8221;, &#8220;spark.executor.instances&#8221;, this kind of properties may not be affected when
setting programmatically through <code>SparkConf</code> in runtime, or the behavior is depending on which
cluster manager and deploy mode you choose, so it would be suggested to set through configuration
file or <code>spark-submit</code> command line options; another is mainly related to Spark runtime control,
like &#8220;spark.task.maxFailures&#8221;, this kind of properties can be set in either way.</p>

<h2 id="viewing-spark-properties">Viewing Spark Properties</h2>

<p>The application web UI at <code>http://&lt;driver&gt;:4040</code> lists Spark properties in the &#8220;Environment&#8221; tab.
This is a useful place to check to make sure that your properties have been set correctly. Note
that only values explicitly specified through <code>spark-defaults.conf</code>, <code>SparkConf</code>, or the command
line will appear. For all other configuration properties, you can assume the default value is used.</p>

<h2 id="available-properties">Available Properties</h2>

<p>Most of the properties that control internal settings have reasonable default values. Some
of the most common options to set are:</p>

<h3 id="application-properties">Application Properties</h3>

<table class="table">
<tr><th>Property Name</th><th>Default</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.app.name</code></td>
  <td>(none)</td>
  <td>
    The name of your application. This will appear in the UI and in log data.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.driver.cores</code></td>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>
    Number of cores to use for the driver process, only in cluster mode.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.driver.maxResultSize</code></td>
  <td>1g</td>
  <td>
    Limit of total size of serialized results of all partitions for each Spark action (e.g. 
    collect) in bytes. Should be at least 1M, or 0 for unlimited. Jobs will be aborted if the total 
    size is above this limit.
    Having a high limit may cause out-of-memory errors in driver (depends on spark.driver.memory
    and memory overhead of objects in JVM). Setting a proper limit can protect the driver from
    out-of-memory errors.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.driver.memory</code></td>
  <td>1g</td>
  <td>
    Amount of memory to use for the driver process, i.e. where SparkContext is initialized, in the
    same format as JVM memory strings with a size unit suffix ("k", "m", "g" or "t")
    (e.g. <code>512m</code>, <code>2g</code>).
    <br />
    <em>Note:</em> In client mode, this config must not be set through the <code>SparkConf</code>
    directly in your application, because the driver JVM has already started at that point.
    Instead, please set this through the <code>--driver-memory</code> command line option
    or in your default properties file.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.driver.memoryOverhead</code></td>
  <td>driverMemory * 0.10, with minimum of 384 </td>
  <td>
    The amount of off-heap memory to be allocated per driver in cluster mode, in MiB unless
    otherwise specified. This is memory that accounts for things like VM overheads, interned strings, 
    other native overheads, etc. This tends to grow with the container size (typically 6-10%). 
    This option is currently supported on YARN and Kubernetes.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.executor.memory</code></td>
  <td>1g</td>
  <td>
    Amount of memory to use per executor process, in the same format as JVM memory strings with
    a size unit suffix ("k", "m", "g" or "t") (e.g. <code>512m</code>, <code>2g</code>).
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td><code>spark.executor.pyspark.memory</code></td>
  <td>Not set</td>
  <td>
    The amount of memory to be allocated to PySpark in each executor, in MiB
    unless otherwise specified.  If set, PySpark memory for an executor will be
    limited to this amount. If not set, Spark will not limit Python's memory use
    and it is up to the application to avoid exceeding the overhead memory space

<p>Note: When running Spark on YARN in <code>cluster</code> mode, environment variables need to be set using the <code>spark.yarn.appMasterEnv.[EnvironmentVariableName]</code> property in your <code>conf/spark-defaults.conf</code> file.  Environment variables that are set in <code>spark-env.sh</code> will not be reflected in the YARN Application Master process in <code>cluster</code> mode.  See the <a href="running-on-yarn.html#spark-properties">YARN-related Spark Properties</a> for more information.</p>

<h1 id="configuring-logging">Configuring Logging</h1>

<p>Spark uses <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/">log4j</a> for logging. You can configure it by adding a
<code>log4j.properties</code> file in the <code>conf</code> directory. One way to start is to copy the existing
<code>log4j.properties.template</code> located there.</p>

<h1 id="overriding-configuration-directory">Overriding configuration directory</h1>

<p>To specify a different configuration directory other than the default &#8220;SPARK_HOME/conf&#8221;,
you can set SPARK_CONF_DIR. Spark will use the configuration files (spark-defaults.conf, spark-env.sh, log4j.properties, etc)
from this directory.</p>

<h1 id="inheriting-hadoop-cluster-configuration">Inheriting Hadoop Cluster Configuration</h1>

<p>If you plan to read and write from HDFS using Spark, there are two Hadoop configuration files that
should be included on Spark&#8217;s classpath:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>hdfs-site.xml</code>, which provides default behaviors for the HDFS client.</li>
  <li><code>core-site.xml</code>, which sets the default filesystem name.</li>
</ul>

<p>The location of these configuration files varies across Hadoop versions, but
a common location is inside of <code>/etc/hadoop/conf</code>. Some tools create
configurations on-the-fly, but offer a mechanism to download copies of them.</p>

<p>To make these files visible to Spark, set <code>HADOOP_CONF_DIR</code> in <code>$SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-env.sh</code>
to a location containing the configuration files.</p>

<h1 id="custom-hadoophive-configuration">Custom Hadoop/Hive Configuration</h1>

<p>If your Spark application is interacting with Hadoop, Hive, or both, there are probably Hadoop/Hive
configuration files in Spark&#8217;s classpath.</p>

<p>Multiple running applications might require different Hadoop/Hive client side configurations.
You can copy and modify <code>hdfs-site.xml</code>, <code>core-site.xml</code>, <code>yarn-site.xml</code>, <code>hive-site.xml</code> in
Spark&#8217;s classpath for each application. In a Spark cluster running on YARN, these configuration
files are set cluster-wide, and cannot safely be changed by the application.</p>

<p>The better choice is to use spark hadoop properties in the form of <code>spark.hadoop.*</code>. 
They can be considered as same as normal spark properties which can be set in <code>$SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf</code></p>

<p>In some cases, you may want to avoid hard-coding certain configurations in a <code>SparkConf</code>. For
instance, Spark allows you to simply create an empty conf and set spark/spark hadoop properties.</p>
