<h2>Apache Spark Community</h2>

<a name="have-questions"></a>
<h3>Have Questions?</h3>

<h4>StackOverflow</h4>

For usage questions and help (e.g. how to use this Spark API), it is recommended you use the 
StackOverflow tag <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/apache-spark">`apache-spark`</a> 
as it is an active forum for Spark users' questions and answers.

Some quick tips when using StackOverflow:

- Prior to asking submitting questions, please:
  - Search StackOverflow's 
  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/apache-spark">`apache-spark`</a> tag to see if 
  your question has already been answered
  - Search the nabble archive for
  <a href="http://apache-spark-user-list.1001560.n3.nabble.com/">user@spark.apache.org</a> 
- Please follow the StackOverflow <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">code of conduct</a>  
- Always use the `apache-spark` tag when asking questions
- Please also use a secondary tag to specify components so subject matter experts can more easily find them.
 Examples include: `pyspark`, `spark-dataframe`, `spark-streaming`, `spark-r`, `spark-mllib`, 
  `spark-ml`, `spark-graphx`, `spark-graphframes`, `spark-tensorframes`, etc. 
- Please do not cross-post between StackOverflow and the mailing lists
- No jobs, sales, or solicitation is permitted on StackOverflow

<h4>Mailing Lists</h4>

For broad, opinion based, ask for external resources, debug issues, bugs, contributing to the 
project, and scenarios, it is recommended you use the user@spark.apache.org mailing list.

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://apache-spark-user-list.1001560.n3.nabble.com">user@spark.apache.org</a> is for usage questions, help, and announcements.
    <a href="mailto:user-subscribe@spark.apache.org?subject=(send%20this%20email%20to%20subscribe)">(subscribe)</a>

    <a href="http://apache-spark-user-list.1001560.n3.nabble.com">(archives)</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com">dev@spark.apache.org</a> is for people who want to contribute code to Spark.
    <a href="mailto:dev-subscribe@spark.apache.org?subject=(send%20this%20email%20to%20subscribe)">(subscribe)</a>
    <a href="mailto:dev-unsubscribe@spark.apache.org?subject=(send%20this%20email%20to%20unsubscribe)">(unsubscribe)</a>

</ul>

Some quick tips when using email:

- Prior to asking submitting questions, please:
  - Search StackOverflow at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/apache-spark">`apache-spark`</a> 
  to see if your question has already been answered
  - Search the nabble archive for
  <a href="http://apache-spark-user-list.1001560.n3.nabble.com/">user@spark.apache.org</a> 
- Tagging the subject line of your email will help you get a faster response, e.g. 
`[Spark SQL]: Does Spark SQL support LEFT SEMI JOIN?`
- Tags may help identify a topic by:
  - Component: Spark Core, Spark SQL, ML, MLlib, GraphFrames, GraphX, TensorFrames, etc
  - Level: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced
  - Scenario: Debug, How-to
- For error logs or long code examples, please use <a href="https://gist.github.com/">GitHub gist</a> 
and include only a few lines of the pertinent code / log within the email.
- No jobs, sales, or solicitation is permitted on the Apache Spark mailing lists.
