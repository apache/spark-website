## Adding new projects

To add a project, open a pull request against the [spark-website](https://github.com/apache/spark-website)  repository. Add an entry to  [this markdown file](https://github.com/apache/spark-website/blob/asf-site/third-party-projects.md),  then run `jekyll build` to generate the HTML too. Include both in your pull request. See the README in this repo for more information.

Note that all project and product names should follow [trademark guidelines](/trademarks.html).
