We are happy to announce the availability of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/releases/spark-release-1-2-0.html" title="Spark Release 1.2.0">Spark 1.2.0</a>! Spark 1.2.0 is the third release on the API-compatible 1.X line. It is Spark's largest release ever, with contributions from 172 developers and more than 1,000 commits!

This release brings operational and performance improvements in Spark core including a new network transport subsystem designed for very large shuffles. Spark SQL introduces an API for external data sources along with Hive 13 support, dynamic partitioning, and the fixed-precision decimal type. MLlib adds a new pipeline-oriented package (spark.ml) for composing multiple algorithms. Spark Streaming adds a Python API and a write ahead log for fault tolerance. Finally, GraphX has graduated from alpha and introduces a stable API.
