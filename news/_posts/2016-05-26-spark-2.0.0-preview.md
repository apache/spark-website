To enable wide-scale community testing of the upcoming Spark 2.0 release, the Apache Spark team has posted a <a href="https://archive.apache.org/dist/spark/spark-2.0.0-preview/">preview release of Spark 2.0</a>. This preview is <b>not a stable release in terms of either API or functionality</b>, but it is meant to give the community early access to try the code that will become Spark 2.0. If you would like to test the release, simply download it, and send feedback using either the <a href="https://spark.apache.org/community.html">mailing lists</a> or <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel">JIRA</a>.
