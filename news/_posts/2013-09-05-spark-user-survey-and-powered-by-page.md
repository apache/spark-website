As we continue developing Spark, we would love to get feedback from users and hear what you'd like us to work on next. We've decided that a good way to do that is a survey -- we hope to run this at regular intervals. If you have a few minutes to participate, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1eMXp4GjcIXglxJe5vYYBzXKVm-6AiYt1KThJwhCjJiY/viewform">fill in the survey here</a>. Your time is greatly appreciated.

In parallel, we are starting a <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SPARK/Powered+By+Spark">"powered by" page</a> on the Apache Spark wiki for organizations that are using, or contributing to, Spark. Sign up if you'd like to support the project! This is a great way to let the world know you're using Spark, and can also be helpful to generate leads for recruiting. You can also add yourself when you fill the survey.

Thanks for taking the time to give feedback.
