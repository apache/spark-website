Spark was recently <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-general/201306.mbox/%3CCDE7B773.E9A48%25chris.a.mattmann@jpl.nasa.gov%3E">accepted</a> into the <a href="http://incubator.apache.org">Apache Incubator</a>, which will serve as the long-term home for the project. While moving the source code and issue tracking to Apache will take some time, we are excited to be joining the community at Apache. Stay tuned on this site for updates on how the project hosting will change.
