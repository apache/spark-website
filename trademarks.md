<h2>Apache Spark Trademark Guidelines</h2>

Apache Spark, Spark and the Spark logo are 
<a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/">trademarks</a>
of the <a href="https://www.apache.org">Apache Software Foundation (ASF)</a>.
The ASF is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, and as such, needs to take
special care about how its trademarks are used by organizations.
In particular, ASF needs to ensure that its software products are clearly
distinguished from third-party products.

If you would like to provide software, services, events, or other products
based on Apache Spark, please refer to the
<a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/">ASF trademark policy</a>
and <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/faq/">FAQ</a>.
This page summarizes the key points of the policy, but please note that
the official policy always takes precedence.

* **Software products,** whether commercial or open source, are not allowed to
  use "Spark" in their name, except in the form "powered by Apache Spark" or
  "for Apache Spark" when following
  <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/faq/#products">these specific
  guidelines</a>.
  * Names derived from "Spark", such as "sparkly", are also not allowed.
  * Company names may not include "Spark".
  * Package identifiers (e.g., Maven coordinates) may include
    "spark", but the full name used for the software package should
    follow the naming policy above.


* **Written materials** must refer to the project as "Apache Spark" in the first
  and most prominent mentions. Materials from software vendors or software-related
  service providers must follow
  <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/guide#howoften">stricter
  guidelines</a>, including using the full project name "Apache Spark" in more
  locations, and proper
  <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/faq/#attribution">trademark
  attribution</a> on every page.

* **Logos** derived from the Spark logo are not allowed.

* **Domain names** containing "spark" are not permitted without written
  permission from the Apache Spark PMC. To request permission, email
  <a href="mailto:private@spark.apache.org">private@spark.apache.org</a> and CC
  <a href="mailto:trademarks@apache.org">trademarks@apache.org</a>.

* **Events, books, and merchandise** have their own guidelines.
  Please refer to the
  <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/">ASF trademark policy</a>
  and <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/faq/">FAQ</a> for details.
  
We appreciate the community's help in respecting these guidelines.
